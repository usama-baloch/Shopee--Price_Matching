# Shopee--Price_Matching

## Description:

Do you scan online retailers in search of the best deals? You're joined by the many savvy shoppers who don't like paying extra for the same product depending on where they shop. Retail companies use various methods to assure customers that their products are the cheapest. Among them is product matching, which allows a company to offer products at competitive rates to the same product sold by another retailer. To perform these matches automatically requires a thorough machine learning approach, which is where your data science skills could help.

Two different images of similar wares may represent the same product or two completely different items. Retailers want to avoid misrepresentations and other issues from conflating two dissimilar products. Currently, a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning analyzes image and text information to compare similarities. However major differences in images, titles, and product descriptions prevent these methods from being entirely effective.

[Shopee](https://shopee.com/) is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. The company also provides strong payment and logistical support along with a 'Lowest Price Guaranteed' feature on thousands of Shopee's listed products.
